I am Denis Peskov, a PhD student studying studying computational linguistics (or NLP) at the University of Maryland.  I am advised by Professor Jordan Boyd-Graber.  My main research interest is leveraging domain experts to create meaningful and accurate datasets.  Additionally, I'm interested in question answering and machine translation.  

In the past, I've worked at Amazon, 3M Healthcare, and PwC.  I will be abroad at Ludwig Maximillian Universit√§t in Munich in 2020 thanks to the DAAD Fellowship.
